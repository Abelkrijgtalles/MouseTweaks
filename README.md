# Mouse Tweaks

A mod that enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons.

# How to build

`gradlew build`

# Compatibility

Mouse Tweaks should work with everything based on `AbstractContainerScreen`. If your GUI isn't based
on `AbstractContainerScreen`, or if you want to provide additional compatibility, take a look
at `src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/`.
